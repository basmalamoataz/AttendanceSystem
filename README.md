# 🎥 Attendance System with Computer Vision  

This project is an **AI-powered attendance system** that uses **computer vision and deep learning** to automatically detect and recognize people in:  
- 📸 Uploaded images  
- 🎞️ Uploaded videos  
- 🎥 Live webcam  

The system leverages a **YOLO-based face detection model** to identify individuals from a predefined database of known faces. Once faces are detected and matched, the app generates a list of attendees.  

The user interface is built with **Streamlit**, making it simple and interactive to:  
- Upload an image or video  
- Capture from webcam in real-time  
- Instantly view detected attendees  
- Log attendance automatically  

This project provides a modern, efficient, and contactless way of managing attendance using **AI + Computer Vision** 🚀
